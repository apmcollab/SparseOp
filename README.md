## SparseOp
Sparse matrix representation of finite dimensional linear operators.

This is not a general sparse matrix class, and it's primary purpose is to collect the non-zero entries of a matrix representation of the operator in such a way that the application of the operator to a one dimensional vector is carried out in a computationally efficient manner with minimal storage requirements.

This class is templated with respect to a vector class Vtype.
